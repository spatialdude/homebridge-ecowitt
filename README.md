# Ecowitt Sensors Homebridge Plugin

A Homebridge plugin providing support for a wide range of **Ecowitt** sensors.

The plugin operates as a service that listens for data reports from an Ecowitt WiFi Gateway or Weather Display Console.

Features include -
* Support for a wide range of sensor types
* Operates locally without the need for any cloud services
* Sensors can be hidden via the plugin settings
* Configurable display units

**Note**: This plugin is a beta and still in development. Please consider this when installing it on your system. Feedback is welcome.

## Requirements
* GW1000 Gateway or HP2551 Weather Display Console

## Installation

#### Option 1: Install via Homebridge Config UI X:

Search for "Ecowitt" in [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) and install `homebridge-ecowitt`.

#### Option 2: Manually Install:

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-ecowitt@beta
```

## Configuration

It is recommended to configure the plugin via the **Settings** UI.

The plugin's **Base Station** settings must be configured before configuring the Ecowitt gateway or display console. 

### MAC Address

This can be found int he *About* screen on the Weather Display Console or via the **WS View** app.

The MAC address is used validate that the data report received is coming from the correct gateway or display console.

### Data Report Service

The **Port** and **Path** settings configure on which port and path the data report service will listen for data reports coming from the gateway or display console.

Typical settings for the are `8080` for the port and `/data/report` for the path. Other values may be used as desired. Depending on your system or network configuration ensure the **Port** number being used is not blocked.

### Geteway / Display Console

After configuring the **Base Station** settings, restart Homebridge and confirm via the status log that there are no errors and that the data report service has been started and is listening.

The gateway or display console can be configured using the Ecowitt **WS View** app. The display console can also be configured directly via its UI.

Before updating the gateway or display console to report its data to the plugin, ensure all the available sensors have been configured and are correctly reporting their data.

The plugin requires the custom weather service to be configured to report data with **Path** and **Port** parameters that match the same in the **Base Station** settings.

The service **Protocol Type** must be configured as **Ecowitt**. The **Upload Interval** can be configured as desired. 20 seconds is recommended as the data report messages are relatively small and do not put much load on the network or Homebridge host. 

It is also recommended to configure the Homebridge host system with a static IP address to avoid issues with address changes after system reboots.

After the gateway or display console has been configuration has been updated, sensor data reports will appear in the Homebridge status log. The plugin will automatically configure the accessories based on the first data report received.

## Notes
### Outdoor Weather Sensors
#### Wind
* Sensors (Can be indvidually hidden via the plugin settings)
    * Direction
    * Speed
    * Gust
    * Maximum Daily Gust 
* Presented as **Motion Sensors**
  * **Motion Detected** status is triggered based on thresholds configured in the plugin settings
* Thresholds are configured using the [Beaufort Scale](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale)
* Wind speed display units can be configured in the plugin setting.
  
#### Rain
* Sensors (Can be individually hidden via the plugin settings)
  * Rate
  * Event
